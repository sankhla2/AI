### ✅ **OS Structures**

How the components of an OS are organized.

#### 1. **Monolithic Kernel**

* Entire OS runs in kernel mode.
* All services (I/O, memory, file system) are tightly integrated.
* Example: Linux, UNIX.

#### 2. **Layered Architecture**

* OS is divided into layers, each built on top of lower ones.
* Top: UI Layer → Bottom: Hardware.
* Easier to debug and design.

#### 3. **Microkernel**

* Minimal kernel that handles only core functions (e.g., IPC, basic scheduling).
* Other services run in user space.
* Example: Minix, QNX.

#### 4. **Modular Kernel**

* Combination of Monolithic and Microkernel.
* Supports dynamic loading/unloading of modules.
* Example: Modern Linux kernels.

#### 5. **Hybrid Kernel**

* Uses Microkernel design but incorporates monolithic components for performance.
* Example: Windows NT, macOS.

---

### ✅ **System Calls vs API**

* **System Call:** Interface between application and OS (invokes kernel functions).

  * Example: `fork()`, `exec()`, `read()`
* **API (Application Programming Interface):** High-level interface offered to developers (e.g., POSIX API).

  * System calls are usually **wrapped in APIs** for ease of use.

---

### ✅ **OS Services**

OS provides services to:

* Program Execution
* I/O Operations
* File System Manipulation
* Communication
* Error Detection
* Resource Allocation
* Accounting
* Protection

---

### ✅ **User Mode vs Kernel Mode**

* **User Mode:** Limited access; used by applications.
* **Kernel Mode:** Full system access; used by OS code.
* Mode switching occurs during **system calls or interrupts**.

---

### ✅ **Boot Process**

Steps the OS takes to start a system.

#### 1. **BIOS/UEFI (Firmware)**

* Performs POST (Power-On Self-Test)
* Loads the Bootloader from disk

#### 2. **Bootloader**

* Loads the kernel into memory (e.g., GRUB)

#### 3. **Kernel Initialization**

* Initializes devices, memory management
* Starts system processes (`init` or `systemd`)

# 🧑‍💻 2. Process Management — **Detailed Explanation**

---

## ✅ **Process Concepts**

### 🔹 **What is a Process?**

A **process** is an active instance of a program in execution. It includes the program code and its current activity, represented by:

* Program Counter (PC)
* Stack (function calls)
* Data section (variables)
* Heap (dynamic memory)

---

### 🔹 **Process Control Block (PCB)**

A **PCB** is a data structure maintained by the OS for every process. It stores:

* Process ID (PID)
* Process state
* Program counter
* CPU registers
* Memory management info (page tables)
* Accounting info (CPU time used)
* I/O status info

---

### 🔹 **Process States**

```plaintext
New → Ready → Running → Terminated
             ↑       ↓
          Waiting ← (I/O or event)
```

* **New**: Process is being created.
* **Ready**: Waiting for CPU.
* **Running**: Executing instructions.
* **Waiting**: Waiting for I/O or event.
* **Terminated**: Finished execution.

---

### 🔹 **Context Switching**

When CPU switches from one process to another, the OS must save the **context** (registers, PC, etc.) of the current process and load the context of the next process.

* Overhead: Takes time (no useful work done)
* Enables multitasking

---

## ✅ **Types of Processes**

| Type                           | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User vs System**             | User processes run in user mode; system processes run in kernel mode.                  |
| **Foreground vs Background**   | Foreground interacts with the user; background does not (e.g., daemons).               |
| **Independent vs Cooperating** | Independent processes don’t share data; cooperating ones do (e.g., via shared memory). |

---

## ✅ **Process Scheduling**

### 🔹 **Scheduling Queues**

* **Job Queue**: All submitted processes.
* **Ready Queue**: Processes ready to run.
* **Device Queue**: Processes waiting for I/O devices.

### 🔹 **Dispatcher**

* Loads selected process from the ready queue to the CPU.
* Performs:

  * Context switch
  * Jump to user mode
  * Restart program counter

### 🔹 **Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling**

| Type               | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Preemptive**     | CPU can be taken away (e.g., Round Robin).     |
| **Non-Preemptive** | CPU runs until the process finishes or blocks. |

---

## 🔁 **Scheduling Algorithms**

### 1. **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**

* Jobs are executed in the order they arrive.
* Non-preemptive
* Simple but may cause **convoy effect** (long process delays short ones).

### 2. **SJF (Shortest Job First)**

* Executes the shortest job first.
* Non-preemptive
* Optimal in terms of **average waiting time**, but needs to know burst time in advance.

### 3. **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)**

* Preemptive version of SJF.
* If a new process arrives with a shorter burst time, it preempts the current one.

### 4. **Priority Scheduling**

* Each process is assigned a priority; highest priority runs first.
* Can be **preemptive or non-preemptive**.
* Problem: **Starvation** (low-priority processes may never run).
* Solution: **Aging** (gradually increasing priority over time).

### 5. **Round Robin (RR)**

* Each process gets a fixed **time quantum**.
* After time expires, it's moved to the back of the queue.
* Fair and preemptive.
* Performance depends on the time quantum.

### 6. **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**

* Multiple queues (foreground, background) with different scheduling algorithms.
* No movement between queues.

### 7. **Multilevel Feedback Queue**

* Like Multilevel Queue, but allows **movement between queues** based on behavior (e.g., CPU-bound vs I/O-bound).
* Adaptive and complex.

### 8. **Lottery Scheduling**

* Each process gets a number of "lottery tickets."
* Scheduler picks a ticket at random.
* Fair, probabilistic, used in some modern systems.
