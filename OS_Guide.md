### ✅ **OS Structures**

How the components of an OS are organized.

#### 1. **Monolithic Kernel**

* Entire OS runs in kernel mode.
* All services (I/O, memory, file system) are tightly integrated.
* Example: Linux, UNIX.

#### 2. **Layered Architecture**

* OS is divided into layers, each built on top of lower ones.
* Top: UI Layer → Bottom: Hardware.
* Easier to debug and design.

#### 3. **Microkernel**

* Minimal kernel that handles only core functions (e.g., IPC, basic scheduling).
* Other services run in user space.
* Example: Minix, QNX.

#### 4. **Modular Kernel**

* Combination of Monolithic and Microkernel.
* Supports dynamic loading/unloading of modules.
* Example: Modern Linux kernels.

#### 5. **Hybrid Kernel**

* Uses Microkernel design but incorporates monolithic components for performance.
* Example: Windows NT, macOS.

---

### ✅ **System Calls vs API**

* **System Call:** Interface between application and OS (invokes kernel functions).

  * Example: `fork()`, `exec()`, `read()`
* **API (Application Programming Interface):** High-level interface offered to developers (e.g., POSIX API).

  * System calls are usually **wrapped in APIs** for ease of use.

---

### ✅ **OS Services**

OS provides services to:

* Program Execution
* I/O Operations
* File System Manipulation
* Communication
* Error Detection
* Resource Allocation
* Accounting
* Protection

---

### ✅ **User Mode vs Kernel Mode**

* **User Mode:** Limited access; used by applications.
* **Kernel Mode:** Full system access; used by OS code.
* Mode switching occurs during **system calls or interrupts**.

---

### ✅ **Boot Process**

Steps the OS takes to start a system.

#### 1. **BIOS/UEFI (Firmware)**

* Performs POST (Power-On Self-Test)
* Loads the Bootloader from disk

#### 2. **Bootloader**

* Loads the kernel into memory (e.g., GRUB)

#### 3. **Kernel Initialization**

* Initializes devices, memory management
* Starts system processes (`init` or `systemd`)

---

### 🔹 Q6: Explain Monolithic vs Microkernel.

**A:**

* **Monolithic:** All OS services run in kernel space.

---

### 🔹 Q7: What is the difference between API and system call?

**A:**

* **System call** is a low-level request to the OS.
* **API** is a high-level abstraction that internally uses system calls.

---

### 🔹 Q8: Describe the boot process.

**A:**

1. **BIOS/UEFI** performs POST and loads bootloader.
2. **Bootloader** loads the OS kernel into memory.
3. **Kernel** initializes hardware and starts system processes.
