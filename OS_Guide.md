* Top: UI Layer → Bottom: Hardware.
* Easier to debug and design.

#### 3. **Microkernel**

* Minimal kernel that handles only core functions (e.g., IPC, basic scheduling).
* Other services run in user space.
* Example: Minix, QNX.

#### 4. **Modular Kernel**

* Combination of Monolithic and Microkernel.
* Supports dynamic loading/unloading of modules.
* Example: Modern Linux kernels.

#### 5. **Hybrid Kernel**

* Uses Microkernel design but incorporates monolithic components for performance.
* Example: Windows NT, macOS.

---

# 🧑‍💻 2. Process Management — **Detailed Explanation**

---

## ✅ **Process Concepts**

### 🔹 **What is a Process?**

A **process** is an active instance of a program in execution. It includes the program code and its current activity, represented by:

* Program Counter (PC)
* Stack (function calls)
* Data section (variables)
* Heap (dynamic memory)

---

### 🔹 **Process Control Block (PCB)**

A **PCB** is a data structure maintained by the OS for every process. It stores:

* Process ID (PID)
* Process state
* Program counter
* CPU registers
* Memory management info (page tables)
* Accounting info (CPU time used)
* I/O status info

---

### 🔹 **Process States**

```plaintext
New → Ready → Running → Terminated
             ↑       ↓
          Waiting ← (I/O or event)
```

* **New**: Process is being created.
* **Ready**: Waiting for CPU.
* **Running**: Executing instructions.
* **Waiting**: Waiting for I/O or event.
* **Terminated**: Finished execution.

---

### 🔹 **Context Switching**

When CPU switches from one process to another, the OS must save the **context** (registers, PC, etc.) of the current process and load the context of the next process.

* Overhead: Takes time (no useful work done)
* Enables multitasking

---

## ✅ **Types of Processes**

| Type                           | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User vs System**             | User processes run in user mode; system processes run in kernel mode.                  |
| **Foreground vs Background**   | Foreground interacts with the user; background does not (e.g., daemons).               |
| **Independent vs Cooperating** | Independent processes don’t share data; cooperating ones do (e.g., via shared memory). |

---

## ✅ **Process Scheduling**

### 🔹 **Scheduling Queues**

* **Job Queue**: All submitted processes.
* **Ready Queue**: Processes ready to run.
* **Device Queue**: Processes waiting for I/O devices.

### 🔹 **Dispatcher**

* Loads selected process from the ready queue to the CPU.
* Performs:

  * Context switch
  * Jump to user mode
  * Restart program counter

### 🔹 **Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling**

| Type               | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Preemptive**     | CPU can be taken away (e.g., Round Robin).     |
| **Non-Preemptive** | CPU runs until the process finishes or blocks. |

---

## 🔁 **Scheduling Algorithms**

### 1. **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**

* Jobs are executed in the order they arrive.
* Non-preemptive
* Simple but may cause **convoy effect** (long process delays short ones).

### 2. **SJF (Shortest Job First)**

* Executes the shortest job first.
* Non-preemptive
* Optimal in terms of **average waiting time**, but needs to know burst time in advance.

### 3. **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)**

* Preemptive version of SJF.
* If a new process arrives with a shorter burst time, it preempts the current one.

### 4. **Priority Scheduling**

* Each process is assigned a priority; highest priority runs first.
* Can be **preemptive or non-preemptive**.
* Problem: **Starvation** (low-priority processes may never run).
* Solution: **Aging** (gradually increasing priority over time).

### 5. **Round Robin (RR)**

* Each process gets a fixed **time quantum**.
* After time expires, it's moved to the back of the queue.
* Fair and preemptive.
* Performance depends on the time quantum.

### 6. **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**

* Multiple queues (foreground, background) with different scheduling algorithms.
* No movement between queues.

### 7. **Multilevel Feedback Queue**

* Like Multilevel Queue, but allows **movement between queues** based on behavior (e.g., CPU-bound vs I/O-bound).
* Adaptive and complex.

### 8. **Lottery Scheduling**

* Each process gets a number of "lottery tickets."
* Scheduler picks a ticket at random.
* Fair, probabilistic, used in some modern systems.

Multiple threads may access shared data → **Race Conditions** occur.

### Synchronization Mechanisms:

* **Mutexes (Mutual Exclusion)**:

  * Ensures only one thread accesses critical section at a time
* **Semaphores**:

  * Generalized locking, can count resources
* **Monitors**:

  * High-level abstraction (automatic locking)
* **Condition Variables**:

  * Used for signaling between threads

---

## ✅ **Thread Scheduling**

* Managed by kernel (KLT) or thread library (ULT)
* Can follow policies like:

  * Round Robin
  * Priority-based
  * FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
* OS schedules threads based on fairness, priority, and real-time constraints.

---

# 💼 Interview Questions with Answers

---

### 🔹 Q1: What is the difference between a thread and a process?

**A:** A process is an independent execution unit with its own memory, while a thread is a lightweight execution unit that shares memory with other threads in the same process.

---

### 🔹 Q2: What is a thread library?

**A:** A thread library provides APIs to create, manage, and synchronize threads. Examples include POSIX threads (`pthreads`), Windows Threads, and Java Threads.

---

### 🔹 Q3: Explain the difference between user-level and kernel-level threads.

**A:**

* **User-Level Threads (ULT):** Managed in user space, fast context switching, not visible to the kernel.
* **Kernel-Level Threads (KLT):** Managed by OS kernel, better concurrency, more overhead.

---

### 🔹 Q4: What are the different multithreading models?

**A:**

* **Many-to-One**: Many user threads → 1 kernel thread (low concurrency)
* **One-to-One**: Each user thread → 1 kernel thread (good concurrency)
* **Many-to-Many**: Many user threads → Many kernel threads (efficient & flexible)

---

### 🔹 Q5: What is thread pooling?

**A:** Thread pooling is a technique where a fixed set of reusable threads is maintained to execute tasks, reducing overhead of thread creation and destruction.

---

### 🔹 Q6: What is a race condition?

**A:** A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared data simultaneously and the result depends on the timing of their execution.

---

### 🔹 Q7: How do you prevent race conditions?

**A:** Use synchronization tools like Mutexes, Semaphores, and Monitors to protect critical sections.

---

### 🔹 Q8: What is the role of a monitor?

**A:** A monitor is a high-level synchronization construct that encapsulates shared variables, the procedures that operate on them, and synchronization between threads.

---

### 🔹 Q9: Which model offers the best scalability: Many-to-One, One-to-One, or Many-to-Many?

**A:** **Many-to-Many** offers the best scalability and performance because it allows flexibility in mapping threads and avoids resource exhaustion.

---

### 🔹 Q10: What happens if one thread in a user-level thread model blocks?

**A:** If one thread blocks in a **Many-to-One model**, all threads block because the kernel sees them as a single thread.

---

**Thread Management** topics using `POSIX Threads (pthreads)` — the standard for multithreading in C on UNIX/Linux systems.

---

# ✅ **3. Thread Management in C with Code Examples (Using `pthreads`)**

---

## 1️⃣ **Threads vs Processes**

(We demonstrate thread creation and compare with processes.)

### 🧵 **Thread Example (Using `pthread_create`)**

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void* myThreadFunc(void* arg) {
    printf("Hello from thread!\n");
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t tid;
    pthread_create(&tid, NULL, myThreadFunc, NULL);
    pthread_join(tid, NULL);
    printf("Thread has finished execution.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 🔄 **Process Example (Using `fork`)**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0)
        printf("Child Process\n");
    else
        printf("Parent Process\n");
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 2️⃣ **User-Level vs Kernel-Level Threads**

In Linux with `pthreads`, you create kernel-level threads. We cannot fully show ULTs in C alone, but you can **observe the difference via thread IDs**:

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void* threadFunc(void* arg) {
    printf("Inside thread. TID: %lu\n", pthread_self());
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t tid;
    pthread_create(&tid, NULL, threadFunc, NULL);
    pthread_join(tid, NULL);
    printf("Main thread finished.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 3️⃣ **Thread Libraries: POSIX (pthreads)**

* Already demonstrated above using:

  * `pthread_create`
  * `pthread_join`

Other useful functions:

```c
pthread_exit();    // Exit thread
pthread_self();    // Get thread ID
pthread_equal();   // Compare thread IDs
```

---

## 4️⃣ **Multithreading Models (Simulated)**

In C with `pthreads`, only **one-to-one** is directly supported (each pthread maps to a kernel thread). Simulation of models:

### ✅ Many-to-One: (Simulated with one kernel thread and manual switch)

Not directly implementable in `pthreads`.

### ✅ One-to-One: Default `pthread_create`

### ✅ Many-to-Many: Requires custom threading libraries or OS support (e.g., GNU Portable Threads), not native to C with pthreads.

---

## 5️⃣ **Thread Pooling Example (Simple Simulation)**

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#define THREAD_COUNT 3

void* task(void* arg) {
    int* id = (int*)arg;
    printf("Thread %d is doing its work.\n", *id);
    free(id);
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t threads[THREAD_COUNT];

    for (int i = 0; i < THREAD_COUNT; i++) {
        int* id = malloc(sizeof(int));
        *id = i + 1;
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, task, id);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < THREAD_COUNT; i++)
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);

    return 0;
}
```

---

## 6️⃣ **Thread Synchronization**

### 🔐 **Using Mutex**

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int counter = 0;
pthread_mutex_t lock;

void* increment(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
        counter++;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t t1, t2;
    pthread_mutex_init(&lock, NULL);

    pthread_create(&t1, NULL, increment, NULL);
    pthread_create(&t2, NULL, increment, NULL);

    pthread_join(t1, NULL);
    pthread_join(t2, NULL);

    pthread_mutex_destroy(&lock);
    printf("Final counter value: %d\n", counter);
    return 0;
}
```

---

### ⚖️ **Using Semaphore**

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <semaphore.h>

int counter = 0;
sem_t sem;

void* increment(void* arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
        sem_wait(&sem);
        counter++;
        sem_post(&sem);
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t t1, t2;
    sem_init(&sem, 0, 1);

    pthread_create(&t1, NULL, increment, NULL);
    pthread_create(&t2, NULL, increment, NULL);

    pthread_join(t1, NULL);
    pthread_join(t2, NULL);

    sem_destroy(&sem);
    printf("Final counter value: %d\n", counter);
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 7️⃣ **Thread Scheduling (Set Priority — Limited Control in Linux)**

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sched.h>

void* threadFunc(void* arg) {
    printf("Running thread...\n");
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t tid;
    pthread_attr_t attr;
    struct sched_param param;

    pthread_attr_init(&attr);
    pthread_attr_setschedpolicy(&attr, SCHED_FIFO); // FIFO policy
    param.sched_priority = 10;
    pthread_attr_setschedparam(&attr, &param);

    pthread_create(&tid, &attr, threadFunc, NULL);
    pthread_join(tid, NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

⚠️ **Note**: You may need **root privileges** to change scheduling policies or priorities.

Absolutely, Renu! Here's a complete and detailed explanation of 📬 **4. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** along with real-world examples and common **interview questions with answers**.

---

# 🧩 4. Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

## ✅ **What is IPC?**

**Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** is a mechanism that allows **processes to exchange data** and **coordinate actions** with one another. Processes may be running on the same machine or over a network.

### 🔑 Why IPC?

* Data sharing between processes
* Event notification
* Resource synchronization
* Load balancing in distributed systems

---

## ✅ IPC Mechanisms

---

### 1️⃣ **Shared Memory**

#### 📘 Concept:

* Multiple processes share a portion of memory.
* Fastest form of IPC since it avoids kernel intervention after setup.

#### 📌 Characteristics:

* Needs **synchronization** (mutex/semaphore) to avoid **race conditions**.
* High performance, low overhead.

#### 📂 Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    key_t key = ftok("shmfile", 65);
    int shmid = shmget(key, 1024, 0666|IPC_CREAT);
    char *str = (char*) shmat(shmid, (void*)0, 0);
    
    printf("Write Data: ");
    fgets(str, 1024, stdin);
    
    printf("Data written in memory: %s\n", str);
    shmdt(str);
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ **Message Passing**

#### 📘 Concept:

* Data is sent as **messages** between processes.
* Works well for **distributed systems** or isolated processes.

#### 📌 Mechanisms:

* **Message Queues** (POSIX / System V)
* **No shared memory required**

#### 📂 Example using POSIX Message Queue:

```c
#include <mqueue.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main() {
    mqd_t mq;
    struct mq_attr attr;
    char buffer[1024] = "Hello from process";

    attr.mq_flags = 0;
    attr.mq_maxmsg = 10;
    attr.mq_msgsize = 1024;
    attr.mq_curmsgs = 0;

    mq = mq_open("/mq1", O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, 0644, &attr);
    mq_send(mq, buffer, strlen(buffer) + 1, 0);
    mq_close(mq);
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Pipes (Unnamed and Named)**

#### ➤ **Unnamed Pipes**

* Used between **parent-child** processes.
* One-way communication only.

#### 📂 Example:

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    int fd[2];
    char msg[] = "Hello, child!";
    char buffer[20];

    pipe(fd); // fd[0] - read, fd[1] - write

    if (fork() == 0) {
        close(fd[1]);
        read(fd[0], buffer, sizeof(buffer));
        printf("Child received: %s\n", buffer);
    } else {
        close(fd[0]);
        write(fd[1], msg, strlen(msg)+1);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

---

#### ➤ **Named Pipes (FIFOs)**

* Allow unrelated processes to communicate.
* Created using `mkfifo()`.

#### 📂 Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int fd;
    char* fifo = "/tmp/myfifo";
    mkfifo(fifo, 0666);

    char arr[80];
    fd = open(fifo, O_WRONLY);
    write(fd, "Hello via FIFO", 14);
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 4️⃣ **Sockets**

#### 📘 Concept:

* Allows **bi-directional communication** between processes on the **same or different machines**.
* Used in **client-server** architecture.

#### 📌 Types:

* **AF\_INET**: Internet sockets (TCP/IP)
* **AF\_UNIX**: Local sockets

#### 📂 TCP Server Example (simplified):

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    struct sockaddr_in server = {0};

    server.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    server.sin_port = htons(8080);

    bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&server, sizeof(server));
    listen(sockfd, 3);

    int client_sock = accept(sockfd, NULL, NULL);
    char buffer[1024];
    read(client_sock, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    printf("Received: %s\n", buffer);

    close(client_sock);
    close(sockfd);
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 5️⃣ **Signals**

#### 📘 Concept:

* Signals are **asynchronous notifications** sent to a process.
* E.g., `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, `SIGKILL`, `SIGALRM`

#### 📂 Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>

void handler(int sig) {
    printf("Caught signal: %d\n", sig);
}

int main() {
    signal(SIGINT, handler); // Ctrl+C
    while (1) {
        printf("Running...\n");
        sleep(1);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

# 💼 Interview Questions with Answers

---

### 🔹 Q1: What is IPC?

**A:** IPC (Inter-Process Communication) allows processes to communicate and share data. It is used to coordinate actions, share resources, and manage dependencies.

---

### 🔹 Q2: Difference between shared memory and message passing?

**A:**

| Feature    | Shared Memory          | Message Passing        |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Speed      | Fast (no system calls) | Slower (uses syscalls) |
| Complexity | Needs synchronization  | Simpler to implement   |
| Use case   | Local communication    | Distributed systems    |

---

### 🔹 Q3: What are named and unnamed pipes?

**A:**

* **Unnamed Pipes**: Exist only during the lifetime of related processes (usually parent-child).
* **Named Pipes (FIFOs)**: Exist in the filesystem and can be used by unrelated processes.

---

### 🔹 Q4: What are sockets used for?

**A:** Sockets enable communication between processes, especially on different systems, using protocols like TCP and UDP.

---

### 🔹 Q5: What is a signal? Give examples.

**A:** A signal is a software interrupt sent to a process to notify it of an event. Examples:

* `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C)
* `SIGTERM` (Termination request)
* `SIGKILL` (Force kill)

---

### 🔹 Q6: What synchronization is required in shared memory IPC?

**A:** Since memory is shared, **mutexes** or **semaphores** must be used to avoid **race conditions** and ensure mutual exclusion.

---

### 🔹 Q7: How does message queue differ from pipes?

**A:**

* Message queues allow message prioritization and can hold multiple messages.
* Pipes are a byte stream, first-in-first-out (FIFO), no message boundaries.

---

### 🔹 Q8: Can a signal interrupt a system call?

**A:** Yes, unless the system call is **reentrant** or **resumes automatically** after the signal.

---

### 🔹 Q9: What happens if a signal is sent to a process not handling it?

**A:** Default action is taken. For example, `SIGTERM` terminates the process.

---

### 🔹 Q10: What IPC mechanism would you use for a client-server chat app?

**A:** **Sockets**, because they allow **bi-directional** and **networked** communication.

---
Absolutely, Renu! Here's a full breakdown of 📌 **5. Process Synchronization** with **detailed explanations**, **C examples**, and **top interview questions + answers**.

---

# 🧩 5. Process Synchronization — Complete Guide

## 📌 What is Process Synchronization?

**Process Synchronization** ensures that multiple processes or threads **do not interfere** with each other while accessing **shared resources**.

It avoids:

* ❌ **Race conditions**
* ❌ **Data inconsistency**
* ✅ Ensures **mutual exclusion**, **progress**, and **bounded waiting**

---

## ✅ Critical Concepts

### 🔸 **1. Critical Section Problem**

* A **critical section** is a segment where the process accesses shared resources.
* Goal: Allow **only one process** at a time in its critical section.

**3 Conditions to satisfy:**

1. **Mutual Exclusion** – Only one process in CS.
2. **Progress** – Non-CS processes must not block others.
3. **Bounded Waiting** – Limit number of times others enter before a process.

---

### 🔸 **2. Race Condition**

Occurs when the **outcome depends on the timing** of uncontrollable events like thread switching.

**Example (in C):**

```c
// Without synchronization
counter = 0;
Thread1: counter++; // Read-Modify-Write
Thread2: counter++;
```

If both read 0 at the same time, result might still be 1 instead of 2.

---

## 🛠️ Synchronization Tools

---

### 🔐 **1. Mutex (Mutual Exclusion Lock)**

* Only one thread can acquire the lock at a time.
* Provides mutual exclusion.

**C Example:**

```c
pthread_mutex_t lock;

pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
// Critical Section
pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
```

---

### 🔐 **2. Semaphores (Binary & Counting)**

* **Binary Semaphore** (0 or 1): Like a mutex.
* **Counting Semaphore**: Allows N accesses.

**C Example (POSIX):**

```c
sem_t sem;
sem_init(&sem, 0, 1); // binary semaphore
sem_wait(&sem);       // lock
// Critical Section
sem_post(&sem);       // unlock
```

---

### 🔐 **3. Spinlocks**

* Busy-wait lock (process keeps checking).
* Suitable for very short critical sections.

**C Example:**

```c
pthread_spinlock_t spin;
pthread_spin_init(&spin, 0);
pthread_spin_lock(&spin);
// Critical section
pthread_spin_unlock(&spin);
```

---

### 🔐 **4. Monitors**

* High-level construct to automatically handle mutual exclusion.
* Provided in Java, but conceptually includes:

  * Shared data
  * Procedures
  * Synchronization (lock)

---

### 🔐 **5. Condition Variables**

* Used with mutexes to wait/signal certain conditions.

**C Example:**

```c
pthread_cond_t cond;
pthread_mutex_t lock;

pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
while (!condition)
    pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &lock);
// Critical Section
pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
```

---

## 🧠 Classical Synchronization Problems

---

### 🥫 **1. Producer-Consumer (Bounded Buffer)**

* Shared buffer of size N
* **Producer** adds, **Consumer** removes

**Solved using:** Semaphores or condition variables

**Semaphores used:**

* `empty` = buffer slots
* `full` = filled slots
* `mutex` = for mutual exclusion

---

### 📚 **2. Readers-Writers Problem**

* **Readers** can read simultaneously
* **Writers** need exclusive access

**Goals:**

* Avoid writer starvation
* Allow max concurrency for readers

---

### 🍝 **3. Dining Philosophers Problem**

* 5 philosophers, 5 forks
* To eat, philosopher needs both left and right forks

**Issues:**

* Deadlock (if all pick left first)
* Starvation

**Solutions:**

* Resource hierarchy
* Odd/even fork picking
* Semaphore with ≤ N-1 philosophers

---

### 💈 **4. Sleeping Barber Problem**

* Barber sleeps if no customer
* Wakes up on arrival

**Solves:**

* Synchronization of barber chair, waiting chairs, and sleeping/wake-up signals

---

## 🧮 Synchronization Algorithms

---

### 🔑 **1. Peterson’s Algorithm (2 processes)**

Satisfies:

* Mutual Exclusion
* Progress
* Bounded Waiting

**Key Idea:**

```c
flag[2]; // interested flags
turn;    // whose turn is it
```

Each process:

```c
flag[i] = true;
turn = j;
while (flag[j] && turn == j); // wait
// critical section
flag[i] = false;
```

---

### 🧁 **2. Lamport’s Bakery Algorithm**

* Generalized for **N processes**
* Like taking a numbered token at a bakery

```c
choosing[i] = true;
number[i] = max(number[0..N]) + 1;
choosing[i] = false;

// wait until all other processes with smaller number finish
```

---

### ⚙️ **3. Test-and-Set Instruction**

Atomic instruction (hardware-level):

```c
bool test_and_set(bool *lock) {
    bool old = *lock;
    *lock = true;
    return old;
}
```

Used in spinlocks.

---

### 🔁 **4. Compare-and-Swap**

```c
bool compare_and_swap(int *ptr, int expected, int new) {
    if (*ptr == expected) {
        *ptr = new;
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

Used for atomic update of shared values.

---

### 🔹 Q7: What are condition variables?

**A:** Used to block a thread until a particular condition is met, often used with mutexes.

---

### 🔹 Q8: What is the use of test-and-set?

**A:** It’s a hardware-supported atomic instruction used to implement spinlocks.

---

### 🔹 Q9: What’s the difference between busy waiting and blocking?

**A:**

* **Blocking:** Process is paused until condition is true (CPU efficient).

---

### 🔹 Q10: What happens if you don’t use synchronization?

**A:** You may get **inconsistent data**, **crashes**, or **unexpected behavior** due to race conditions.

---
Absolutely, Renu! Here's a complete breakdown of 🔒 **6. Deadlocks** — including **concepts**, **examples**, and **top interview questions with answers** — to help you revise efficiently.

---

# 🔐 6. Deadlocks — Complete Guide

---

## ✅ What is a Deadlock?

A **deadlock** is a situation where a group of processes are all **waiting for each other** to release resources, but **none of them ever do**, so they all remain blocked forever.

---

## 🔹 **1. Coffman’s Necessary Conditions for Deadlock**

A deadlock can occur **only if all four conditions hold simultaneously**:

| Condition           | Meaning                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Mutual Exclusion | Resources can’t be shared; only one process can use them at a time.           |
| 2. Hold and Wait    | A process holds at least one resource and waits for another.                  |
| 3. No Preemption    | Resources cannot be forcibly taken; only released voluntarily.                |
| 4. Circular Wait    | A cycle of processes exists where each waits for a resource held by the next. |

---

## 🔹 **2. Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)**

Used to **model processes and resources**.

### ➤ Notation:

* **Processes (circles)**: e.g., P1, P2
* **Resources (squares)**: e.g., R1, R2
* Edge from **process → resource**: request
* Edge from **resource → process**: allocation

### ➤ Deadlock Detection:

* A **cycle in RAG** indicates a **deadlock (for single resource per type)**.

---

## 🔹 **3. Deadlock Prevention**

**Idea**: Eliminate at least one of the Coffman conditions.

| Condition Broken | Method                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Mutual Exclusion | Make resources shareable (not always possible)       |
| Hold and Wait    | Require process to request all resources at once     |
| No Preemption    | Allow OS to take resources forcibly                  |
| Circular Wait    | Impose ordering of resource requests (numerical IDs) |

✅ Works, but often **restrictive or inefficient**

---

## 🔹 **4. Deadlock Avoidance**

Use knowledge of **future requests** to ensure the system never enters an **unsafe state**.

---

### 🟢 **Safe State**

A system is in a **safe state** if it is possible to allocate resources in some order without leading to a deadlock.

---

### 🧮 **Banker’s Algorithm (Dijkstra)**

Used for **deadlock avoidance** by simulating allocation to check if a system remains in a **safe state**.

### ➤ Assumptions:

* Each process declares its **maximum resource need** in advance.
* OS grants requests only if it keeps the system in a **safe state**.

### ➤ Main Data Structures:

* **Available\[]**: Available resources
* **Max\[]\[]**: Max resources required by each process
* **Allocation\[]\[]**: Current resources allocated
* **Need\[]\[]** = Max – Allocation

---

### 🔁 Steps:

1. Check if request ≤ Need and request ≤ Available
2. Pretend to allocate
3. Check system remains safe using **safety algorithm**
4. If yes → allocate; else → make the process wait

---

## 🔹 **5. Deadlock Detection**

Allow deadlock to occur but detect it using a **Wait-for Graph** (simplified version of RAG with processes only).

### ➤ Wait-for Graph:

* Edge from **P1 → P2** means **P1 is waiting for P2**

🔁 **Cycle in graph** = deadlock

---

## 🔹 **6. Deadlock Recovery**

Once detected, OS must recover using:

### 🔧 Methods:

1. **Process Termination**:

   * Kill one by one (minimum cost or priority)
   * Kill all deadlocked processes

2. **Resource Preemption**:

   * Forcefully take resources from processes
   * Risk of inconsistency or starvation

---

## 🔹 **7. Starvation vs Deadlock**

| Feature    | Deadlock                      | Starvation                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Cause      | Circular wait + resource hold | Low-priority process keeps getting bypassed |
| Detection  | Cycle in RAG                  | No fixed way, depends on scheduling         |
| Resolution | Deadlock recovery             | Aging (increasing priority over time)       |

🔄 The **MMU (Memory Management Unit)** converts logical → physical addresses at runtime.

---

## 🔹 3. MMU (Memory Management Unit)

A **hardware device** that translates logical (virtual) addresses to physical addresses.

* Stores base and limit registers.
* Enables **dynamic relocation**.

---

## 🔹 4. Swapping

Swapping is the process of **moving a process in and out of RAM** to/from disk (backing store) to make room for other processes.

✅ Increases degree of multiprogramming
❌ Slower due to disk I/O

---

## 🔹 5. Contiguous Allocation

Allocates **a single continuous block** of memory per process.

### ➤ Types:

#### ✅ Fixed Partitioning:

---

## 📦 7. Paging

### 🔸 What is Paging?

Memory is divided into **fixed-size frames** and processes into **pages**.

| Component | Role                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Page**  | A fixed-size piece of process         |
| **Frame** | A fixed-size piece of physical memory |

🔄 Pages are mapped to frames using a **Page Table**.

---

### 🔹 Page Table

Each process has a **page table**:

* Maps page number → frame number

---

### 🔹 Inverted Page Table

* One global table for the entire system
* Index = frame number
* Stores (PID, Page Number)
  ✅ Space-efficient for large memory systems

---

### 🔹 TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)

* A fast **hardware cache** of recent page table entries.
* Reduces memory access time.

---

### 🔹 Multi-level Paging

* Used when page tables are **too large** to fit in memory.

Absolutely, Renu! Here's your **🧠 Virtual Memory (VM) – Complete OS Revision Notes**, including all concepts, diagrams, and **top interview questions with answers**.

---

# 🧠 8. Virtual Memory – Detailed Explanation

---

## 🔹 What is Virtual Memory?

**Virtual Memory** allows processes to execute **even if they are not fully loaded into RAM**. It creates an **illusion of a large contiguous memory space** using **disk storage**.

📌 It supports:

* Multiprogramming
* Large programs
* Memory protection

---

## 🔹 Key Concepts

---

### 🔸 1. **Demand Paging**

Only loads **pages that are needed** (on demand) instead of the entire program.

**Steps:**

1. Access a page
2. If not in memory → **page fault**
3. OS loads it from disk into RAM

✅ Saves memory
❌ Page faults slow down performance

---

### 🔸 2. **Copy-on-Write (COW)**

Used in **process creation (fork)**. Initially, **parent and child share memory** pages marked as read-only.

If one tries to write:

* Page is duplicated (copy made)
* New copy is writable

✅ Efficient memory use
✅ Reduces overhead of `fork()`

---

### 🔸 3. **Page Fault**

Occurs when a process tries to access a page **not currently in memory**.

**Handling Steps:**

1. Trap to OS
2. Find page on disk
3. Choose a **frame** (possibly evict another)
4. Load page
5. Update page table
6. Resume process

---

### 🔸 4. **Memory-Mapped Files**

Files are mapped to virtual memory.

✅ Allows file I/O via memory access (`mmap()`)
✅ Speeds up read/write

---

### 🔸 5. **Thrashing**

When CPU spends **more time swapping pages** in/out of memory than executing actual instructions.

📉 Indicates:

* Overloaded memory
* Poor page replacement policy

---

### 🔸 6. **Working Set Model**

Each process has a **working set** of recently used pages (W(t)).

**Goal**: Keep entire working set in memory to avoid thrashing.

---

### 🔸 7. **Page Fault Frequency (PFF)**

Tracks **rate of page faults**.

📊 If PFF is:

* Too high → increase memory
* Too low → decrease memory

Helps dynamically adjust memory allocation.

---

### 🔸 8. **Belady’s Anomaly**

In **FIFO**, increasing number of page frames can sometimes lead to **more page faults**.

🔄 Happens in specific access patterns (e.g., loop).

---

## 🔄 Page Replacement Algorithms

When no free frame is available, OS replaces an existing page.

---

### 🔁 **1. FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**

* Evicts the **oldest loaded page**

❌ May suffer from **Belady’s Anomaly**

---

### 🕑 **2. LRU (Least Recently Used)**

* Evicts the **least recently accessed** page

✅ Based on recent usage
❌ Hard to implement in hardware (needs tracking)

---

### 🌟 **3. Optimal Replacement**

* Replaces the page that **won’t be used for the longest time**

✅ Best performance
❌ Not implementable (needs future knowledge)

---

### 🔁 **4. LFU (Least Frequently Used)**

* Removes the page used **least often**

❌ Can penalize old pages even if frequently used recently

---

### 🔁 **5. MFU (Most Frequently Used)**

* Removes the **most frequently** used page

🔍 Based on idea: If used a lot, maybe it won’t be needed again soon

---

### 🕐 **6. Second-Chance (Clock)**

* Enhances FIFO with a **reference bit**

🕰️ Each page gets a “second chance” before eviction.

**Steps:**

* If reference bit = 1 → clear it, skip
* If 0 → replace

✅ Efficient approximation of LRU

---

## 🔢 Allocation Algorithms

---

### ⚖️ **1. Equal Allocation**

All processes get **equal number of frames**

❌ May waste memory if some processes need more

---

### 📊 **2. Proportional Allocation**

Frames allocated based on process **size or priority**

Example:

```text
Process A (size 100) and B (size 200) → A: 1/3 frames, B: 2/3 frames
```

✅ More fair and realistic

---

### 🌐 **3. Global vs Local Allocation**

| Type       | Description                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Global** | Any process can take any frame from the system        |
| **Local**  | A process can only replace pages in its own frame set |

✅ Global: Better throughput
✅ Local: More predictable performance

---

---

### 🔹 Q4: What is Copy-on-Write?

**A:** A memory optimization used during `fork()` where parent and child initially share pages, and **only copy them on modification**.

---

### 🔹 Q5: What causes thrashing?

**A:** Excessive page faults due to insufficient memory allocation, leading to **more time in swapping than computing**.

---

### 🔹 Q6: What is Belady’s Anomaly?

| -------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Based on       | Load time                 | Recent usage                |
| Performance    | Poor (may cause Belady’s) | Better                      |
| Implementation | Easy                      | Complex (requires tracking) |

---

### 🔹 Q8: What is the working set model?

**A:** A method that tracks the **set of pages a process actively uses**. Ensures these pages are in memory to reduce faults.

---

### 🔹 Q9: What is TLB and how does it help?

**A:** TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) is a **hardware cache** for page table entries. Reduces access time for virtual memory.

---

### 🔹 Q10: Difference between global and local replacement?

**A:**

* **Global**: Any process can evict any page.
* **Local**: A process can evict only its own pages.

## 🔸 3. Bad Block Recovery

### 🧩 Methods:

* **Manual Marking** using tools like `chkdsk` or `badblocks`
* **ECC (Error Correction Code)** to detect & correct errors
* **Sector Sparing** (remap bad block to spare one)

---

## 📅 4. Disk Scheduling Algorithms

These determine the order of disk access requests to **minimize seek time**.

---

### 1. **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**

* Process requests in arrival order.

✅ Fair, simple
❌ High average seek time

---

### 2. **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**

* Choose the request **closest to current head**.

✅ Better than FCFS
❌ May cause **starvation** of distant requests

---

### 3. **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**

* Head moves in one direction, serving requests, then reverses.

✅ Better distribution
❌ Slight delay at edges

---

### 4. **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)**

* Head moves only in one direction; **jumps back quickly** to start.

✅ More uniform wait time
✅ No backtracking

---

### 5. **LOOK**

* Like SCAN but **reverses only at the last request** in direction (not at end of disk).

✅ Efficient travel

---

### 6. **C-LOOK**

* Like C-SCAN but **jumps to lowest pending request** instead of disk’s end.

✅ Minimum head movement

---

| Algorithm | Avg Seek Time   | Starvation | Directional |
| --------- | --------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| FCFS      | High            | No         | No          |

* Optimal for **periodic, independent** tasks with deadlines = periods.

🧠 Limitation: Works only if CPU utilization ≤ 69% (for n → ∞)

---

### 2. **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)**

* **Dynamic Priority**: Task with **nearest deadline** gets scheduled first.

✅ Utilization can go up to 100%
✅ More flexible than RMS
❌ More overhead (needs constant re-evaluation)

---

### 3. **Priority Inversion**

Occurs when:

* A **low-priority task** holds a resource (e.g., lock)
* A **high-priority task** is blocked
* Meanwhile, **medium-priority tasks** run and delay resolution

🧨 Can **break real-time guarantees**

---

## 🔸 Solutions to Priority Inversion

---

### 🔐 A. **Priority Inheritance**

* The **low-priority task temporarily inherits** the **higher priority** until it releases the resource.

---

### 🔐 B. **Priority Ceiling Protocol**

* Each resource is assigned a **priority ceiling**
* A task can only acquire a resource if its priority is **higher than the ceiling of any currently locked resource**

📌 Avoids **deadlocks + unbounded blocking**

# 🧩 16. System Calls & APIs

# ☁️ 17. Virtualization & Cloud OS

*With detailed explanations + interview Q\&A*

---

## 🧩 **16. System Calls & APIs**

---

### 🔹 What is a System Call?

A **system call** is the **interface between a user program and the OS kernel**.

📌 It allows user-level processes to request services like file I/O, process control, etc.

> System Call = Controlled entry point into kernel mode.

---

### 🔸 System Call Interface

* User process makes a system call → Traps into kernel mode → Executes → Returns to user space.

**In C:**

```c
#include <unistd.h>
pid_t pid = fork();  // System call to create process
```

---

## 🔸 Types of System Calls

| Category                    | Purpose                                 | Examples                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Process Control**         | Create, execute, terminate processes    | `fork()`, `exec()`, `exit()`, `wait()`   |
| **File Manipulation**       | Open, read, write, close files          | `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()` |
| **Device Management**       | Request or release device               | `ioctl()`, `read()`, `write()`           |
| **Information Maintenance** | Get/set time, user info, etc.           | `getpid()`, `alarm()`, `sleep()`         |
| **Communication**           | Between processes (IPC, pipes, signals) | `pipe()`, `signal()`, `shmget()`         |

---

### 🧪 Common UNIX/Linux System Calls

| Function | Description                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `fork()` | Creates a new process (child)        |
| `exec()` | Replaces current process image       |
| `wait()` | Waits for child process to terminate |
| `exit()` | Terminates the current process       |
| `kill()` | Sends a signal to a process          |

---

### 🔸 API vs System Call

| API (Application Programming Interface) | System Call                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Programmer-level function               | Kernel-level entry point     |
| e.g., C stdlib                          | e.g., Linux syscall          |
| May wrap many syscalls internally       | Direct access to OS features |

---

## 💼 Interview Questions: System Calls

---

### 🔹 Q1: What is a system call?

**A:** A system call allows a user program to request a service from the OS (e.g., I/O, process management).

---

### 🔹 Q2: What's the difference between `fork()` and `exec()`?

| `fork()`                       | `exec()`                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Creates new child process      | Replaces current process image |
| Returns twice (child & parent) | Returns only if failed         |

---

### 🔹 Q3: How is a system call different from an API?

**A:** APIs are **high-level functions**, while system calls are **low-level OS entry points**. API may use multiple system calls internally.

---

### 🔹 Q4: What happens when you call `wait()`?

**A:** The parent process **blocks until the child terminates**, collecting its exit status.

---

### 🔹 Q5: What does `kill()` do?

    pid = fork();  // Create child process

    if (pid < 0) {
        perror("fork failed");
        return 1;
    }

    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child PID: %d, Parent PID: %d\n", getpid(), getppid());

        // Replace child process image with ls command
        execl("/bin/ls", "ls", "-l", NULL);

        // If execl fails
        perror("exec failed");
        exit(1);
    } else {
        // Parent process
        int status;
        wait(&status);  // Wait for child to finish

        if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
            printf("Child exited with status: %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### 🔍 Output Behavior:

* `fork()` creates a child process
* `execl()` replaces child’s memory with `ls -l`
* `wait()` ensures the parent waits for the child to finish
